# Sprint1

## User stories:
* View Listings - BE: As a user, I want to be able to view available listings. For now, a listing includes just a name. This will be expanded upon later.
* View Listings - FE: As a user, I want to be able to view a list of listings and interact with them to find out more information. For now the only information they give is their title
* Post a Sublease - BE: As a user, I want to be able to post an opening for a sublease.
* Post a Sublease - FE: As a user I want to be able to input the information for a sublease and post it to the screen. 
* Edit a Sublease - BE: As a user, I want to be able to edit a sublease posting that I have previously posted, so that I am able to change the info I have previously provided.
* Edit a Sublease - FE: As a user, I want to be able to change the details of my sublease with guiding buttons and input bins. 

## What we planned:
* View Listings - BE/FE
* Post a Sublease - BE/FE
* Edit a Sublease - BE/FE

## What we accomplished:
* View Listings - BE/FE
* Post a Sublease - BE
* Edit a Sublease - BE

## Incomplete issues:
* Edit a Sublease- FE: Did not create an interactive form that represents the post for the sublease, the only information requested from the backend was the postâ€™s name.
* Post a sublease - FE: Did not establish a connection to the backend, still need to make a request from the server once a user attempts to post a listing. 

## Areas for improvement:
* Use branches to create features in a safer and more organized manner
* Keep up with documentation (we have none so far)
* Assign user stories to specific people at the beginning of the sprint so they know what to work on
